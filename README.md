# Score-Based-diffusion-Model

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for the "Score Based Diffusion Model" project, which utilizes the concept of score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equations, 
as detailed in the research paper "Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations" by Yang Song, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Diederik P. Kingma, Abhishek Kumar, Stefano Ermon, and Ben Poole. 
This project aims to generate high-quality images using a Score-Based Diffusion Model, and it leverages the Cassava TensorFlow dataset consisting of 9,430 images for training and evaluation.

## Introduction
Image generation has made significant strides in recent years, with generative models like GANs and VAEs producing impressive results. The Score-Based Diffusion Model represents a novel 
approach to generative modeling, focusing on the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model the dynamics of data.
This project explores the application of the Score-Based Diffusion Model for image generation using the Cassava TensorFlow dataset.

## Research Paper
The core inspiration for this project comes from the research paper titled "Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations" 
by Yang Song, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Diederik P. Kingma, Abhishek Kumar, Stefano Ermon, and Ben Poole. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to generative modeling through SDEs
and introduces the concept of score-based generative models, which form the basis for our image generation model. You can access the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456).

## Cassava TensorFlow Dataset
The Cassava TensorFlow dataset is a critical component of this project. It consists of 9,430 images and is used for training and evaluating the Score-Based Diffusion Model.
The Cassava dataset is specifically curated for tasks related to cassava leaf disease classification, 
making it a challenging but relevant dataset for our image generation experiment. You can find more information about this dataset [here](https://knowyourdata-tfds.withgoogle.com/#tab=STATS&dataset=cassava).

## Usage
